# Chess Reports Integration Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up the chess reports functionality that has been integrated into your PawnsPoses website.

## 📋 What Was Added

1. **New "Reports" tab** in the website header alongside Home, About, Gallery, and Contact
2. **Complete report generation system** with AI-powered analysis
3. **Chess game import** functionality from Lichess and Chess.com
4. **Comprehensive report display** with multiple sections:
   - Executive Summary
   - Weakness Analysis
   - Game Phase Analysis (Middlegame & Endgame)
   - Improvement Plan

## 🔧 Setup Requirements

### 1. Install Dependencies
The following dependencies have been added to your project:
- `@google/generative-ai` - For AI analysis
- `@chrisoakman/chessboardjs` - For chess board display
- `chess.js` - For chess game processing
- `react-chessboard` - React chess board component
- `html2pdf.js` - For PDF export functionality
- `jspdf` - PDF generation

### 2. Environment Variables
You need to add a Google Gemini API key to your environment variables:

1. **Get a Gemini API Key**:
   - Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Create a new API key
   - Copy the key

2. **Add to your .env file**:
   ```
   REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Copy from .env.example**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Then edit the `.env` file and add your actual API key.

## 🚀 How It Works

### User Flow:
1. User clicks "Reports" in the header
2. User selects chess platform (Lichess or Chess.com)
3. User enters their username
4. System validates the username exists
5. User selects number of games to analyze (1-100)
6. User clicks "Generate Report"
7. System fetches games from the chess platform
8. AI analyzes the games and generates insights
9. User receives comprehensive report with actionable recommendations

### Report Sections:
- **Executive Summary**: Win rates, favorite openings, overall statistics
- **Weakness Analysis**: Recurring mistakes with specific examples
- **Game Phase Analysis**: Middlegame and endgame performance breakdown
- **Improvement Plan**: Actionable steps, weekly focus areas, resources

## 🎯 Features

   ```

2. **Navigate to Reports**:
